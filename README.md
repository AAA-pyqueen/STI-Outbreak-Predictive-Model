# 🔬 STI Outbreak Predictive Model
_A machine learning-powered web app for early detection of STI outbreaks using genomic data._

## 🚀 Overview
This interactive STI Outbreak Predictive Model uses machine learning and genomic data to predict outbreaks of Syphilis, HPV, HSV, and HIV. The app allows users to:
- ✅ Upload their own datasets for prediction
- ✅ Fetch real-time genomic data from NCBI
- ✅ View outbreak predictions using interactive maps
- ✅ Provide feedback to improve model accuracy
