# Predictive Model for Infectious Disease Outbreaks

## Overview
This project develops a predictive model for early detection of infectious disease outbreaks using genomic data and machine learning. It utilizes Open-Source data from NCBI Datasets, integrates metadata such as outbreak locations and dates, and applies TensorFlow for model training and evaluation.

## Requirements
Ensure you have Python installed (>=3.7). The necessary dependencies are listed in `requirements.txt`.

## Setup
Run the following commands to set up the environment:

```bash
chmod +x setup.sh
./setup.sh
```

## Running the Model
Once the environment is set up, execute the following command to train and evaluate the model:

```bash
python infectious_disease_model.py
```

## Results
Evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score will be displayed after training. You can visualize the training history with matplotlib.

## Notes
- Ensure internet access for fetching genomic and metadata from NCBI.
- Modify the dataset paths if needed, and check back for changes as this project is currently ongoing.
